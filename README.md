## Hi, I'm Stacey 👋

I'm a software engineer with an interest in programming languages and the web. I
recently spent time at the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=4b09801ab494151291278015fdbdd197)
implementing [TCP in Rust](https://github.com/staceytay/tcp), amongst other
things. I wrote about my experience
[here](https://stace.dev/rc-06-return-statement/). Previously, I was at Shopify
where I built Shopify Payments’ credit cards import service and before that at
Carousell where I worked on creating [fast web
experiences](https://medium.com/carousell-insider/how-we-made-carousells-mobile-web-experience-3x-faster-bbb3be93e006).
